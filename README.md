# USB Analyzer
A simple tool to analyze log files of USB captures. Intended to analyze captures with a logic analyzer, where you can't just use wireshark or other software to listen to the USB protocol. Currently it only supports log files generated by the KingstVIS-Analyzer, but the source format is easily expandable upon.

Currently only USB 2.0 is supported and only Setup-Packets are parsed. Currently, only descriptors for MIDI, NCM and COM-Emulation using CDC are parsed.

If you want a specific descriptor supported or a specific input format, feel free to create an issue. For inputs, please provide a sample capture.
