# USB Analyzer
A simple tool to analyze log files of USB captures. Intended to analyze captures with a logic analyzer, where you can't just use wireshark or other software to listen to the USB protocol. Currently it only supports log files generated by the KingstVIS-Analyzer, but the source format is easily expandable upon.

If you want a deeper analysis of the contents, you can also export the data to wireshark (Bulk & Interrupt only at the moment). In contrast to wireshark, this tool gives more of a low level look at the usb protocol, including e.g. SOF-Packages and every single transmission that results in a single bulk transfer, which helps with debugging the low level aspects of the protocol.

Currently only USB 2.0 is supported and only Setup-Packets are parsed. Currently, only descriptors for MIDI, NCM and COM-Emulation using CDC are parsed.

If you want a specific descriptor supported or a specific input format, feel free to create an issue. For inputs, please provide a sample capture.
